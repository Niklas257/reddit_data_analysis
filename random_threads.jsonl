I live different than most.  I don't even want to get rich.  If I ever made a ton of money, I'd just try and help starving kids or foodbanks.  My currency is love.  I want to love all around me and help everyone get by that I can.  I take the Bible to heart the best I can with a zealous fervor.  Jesus who died on a cross is worthy of zealous followers.  If you go all in for God, he goes beyond all in for you.  You might lose out on stupid fun of blowing money on yourself, but God gives stupid fun to you by raising your very senses and ability to enjoy life, etc, and yes miracles can happen more likely if you're more for the cause of God.\n\n\n&gt; Why do the least of sins make us go to hell? Why is there eternal torture and punishment for such little things?\n\nThis one is simple.  You separate two groups: Those who want to obey the God of Love and always live in love, and those who want to disobey the God of Love to hate and harm each other.  God could give both groups the same paradise universe, but those who hate and harm each other will rapidly turn it into a hell.\n\n&gt; Why are there so many contradictions in the Bible, such as \" fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury. \" (Leviticus 24:20) and \" If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. \" (Luke 6:29)\n\nGod wants us all loving each other.  So there should be penalties for hurting one another so people don't do it.  If you look at most major modern civilizations, their laws are heavily influenced by 3300 year old Mosaic Law.\n\n\nKeep shooting questions.  I want to help your faith.

Also with the recent economic downturn would this be a good opportunity to invest in real estate?

My 16 year old daughter recently found out she more than likely has endometriosis. Her doctor didn’t wanna do the surgery to officially confirm it and instead just prescribed birth control to help with her extremely painful periods. She said the surgery was unnecessary and she wouldn’t put my daughter through the pain because of that and just kind of swept it under the rug.\n\nIt very well could not be endometriosis but something is definitely going on which is why the doctor came to the conclusion of it. Her periods are sometimes so painful that she screams and cries my name and calls me “mommy” and begs for help when she gets the pains. There’s been a few times where she’s been in the store and had to leave because she felt a big cramp coming on, which is why we took her to the doctor in the first place. Not to mention there are times when she literally wets her pants because she gets SUCH a strong uncontrollable cramp. It’s very heartbreaking seeing my baby girl go through that stuff. \n\nAs soon as we got home from the doctors office she instantly reached to Google and found out that 30-50% of women with it are infertile. And that those who do conceive a child are 80% more likely to miscarry than those without endometriosis. \n\nWhen she found out she cried for nearly an hour. Sobbing, hyperventilating crying and it broke my heart. She told me she didn’t want kids anytime soon but knowing that someday she might not have any at all really hurt her. \n\nI tried telling her that there are other options if she does happen to be infertile but that didn’t help. She googled the cost of IVF and cried because it’s so expensive. She told me that it just hurts that she can’t carry her own kid.\n\nShe’s a very family oriented girl, loves children and has been babysitting since she was 10. But she’s really changed since finding this out and I don’t know how to help her. I have 5 children and she mentions that every time I try and help. It almost seems as if she’s mad at me somehow. \n\nShe seems to be envious and loathe her brother and his wife as they recently had a baby. She blocked them on any social media and refuses to see them anymore.

I am not referring to classic liberalism.\n\nThere is a trend in policies that are “feel good” initiatives. They have no data to back projected results and actually it doesn’t really matter if the policy achieves any of its intended goal. So long as it sounds good on paper. I will give some examples...\n\n“Healthcare Insurance is a Human Right”\nWhile this sounds all well and good, it’s more certainly not. First you have to understand what a Human Right is. What’s makes something a Human Right in the first place? Human Rights are unalienable, endowed by our creator and most importantly intrinsic. Health Insurance doesn’t fit into any of that criteria. \n\nOne might say... who cares. “People shouldn’t die because they don’t have health insurance.” Is this really a fair statement? “Babies shouldn’t die because the mother doesn’t want them.” See how that works? “No one should have to suffer anything.” Oh cry me a River!\n\nLiberal policies usually don’t take into account the cost or downside. If it feels good in a sentence then it doesn’t matter the cost, right? After all, you can’t put a price on human life right? So we should expend everything at that cost. Don’t even worry about it... “we’re saving lives”. \n\nWhat if you’re not though? What if the cost to give everyone health insurance literally bankrupts all healthcare? What if it lowers the quality of medicine so low that more people in treatment die than recover? So everyone has insurance, great... are we still saving lives or has the death toll actually gone up? Medical research is out to a halt, so good bye cures and new vaccines.\n\nYou could make the argument that, well that’s not what happens in Nordic countries so it won’t turn out that way here. They’re a country, we’re a country. Just install the program right? Well Sweden has a population of 10 million and the US has a population of 330 million. And unlike their 50% work force we have more like a 35% workforce. So ~110m support the other ~220m people in this country. \n\nWe can debate all this but I’m just using this as an example that liberal policies don’t usually do deep dive calculations. They like to sensationalize and get people amped. “A Mother shouldn’t have to work two jobs just so she can feed her children”. Who said she had to become a mother? Who told her not to get a career first? Was she forced into this situation at gunpoint or did she make poor decisions in her life that got her to where she is? \n\nEducation &gt; Marriage &gt; House &gt; Kids\nThat’s the order for success. Tried and True.\n\nIf you look at every policy that Gov. Gavin Newsom in California has passed you will see a plethora of examples. Emotionally charged policies that sound great on paper but don’t actually improve society, the economy or accomplish their intended goals. In fact they not only do no good but they do considerable harm. Small Business are dead or on life support in California because of this clown. \n\nLiberal policies don’t work because they use no measured approach. Conservative policies on the other hand are by nature, slow and measured. That’s the nature of making conservative decisions and implementation.\n\nHope that answers your question 😁", "score": 5, "author": "michaelkghaly", "parent_id": "fqzlnon"}, "comments_to_comments_3": {"created_utc": 1589779668, "id": "fqzzt9u", "body": "&gt; Well Sweden has a population of 10 million and the US has a population of 330 million.

She was about to be valedictorian at graduation this Spring.\n\nShe has a tiktok account where she posts videos of herself and ones she takes at school and home. Some of them are kind of nasty, filming people unaware to make them the butt of jokes. She's filmed me for it, including filming me when I was crying.\n\nI made her take down the video of me but she still did similar things to other people. I honestly didn't get all the jokes, some were weird tik tok inside jokes I guess? But they had people being sneakily filmed and made the butt of a joke, which isn't cool.\n\nSo after a while of that, I went and screen recorded all of her nastiest videos and sent an email to the school guidance counselor. I used a throw away email address and said that I wanted to anonymously report bullying by a student at the school towards other students. And to watch the videos attached. I pretended to be a concerned bystander rather than someone who was bullied.\n\nAnd the school took it really seriously, they talked to everyone in the videos, and their families, and took disciplinary action, suspending my sister and one of her best friends. \n\nBecause my sister was suspended, she wasn't able to be valedictorian anymore. Another girl at school got the title.\n\nMy sister and parents are mad.\n\nMy sister is pissed at the other girl who she says doesn't deserve to be valedictorian because she came to school after being homeschooled just that year so she only needed to keep her grades up for one year, compared to her four years. \n\nMy parents are furious because my sister losing the valedictorian title means she lost her full ride scholarship and my family will be in a much worse financial situation having to pay towards her college. They're furious at whoever \"cowardly person sent in that report without even telling them\". \n\nThey wanted a chance to resolve things before it came to this, and said whoever's parents had known about this and not talked to them before getting the school involved were cowardly, for not even trying to have a parent-to-parent talk.\n\nThey were mad at being blindsided because the school had already made the decision to suspend my sister (and make her lose her valedictorian title and scholarship) before they even knew anything was up. \n\nNobody knows I sent that email. I had been thinking of coming clean but after the way my parents have been so furious at that anonymous person... I don't think I will.\n\nI feel like my parents care more about my sister becoming valedictorian, and having a full ride scholarship, then they care about anything else. They've been so involved in her academics and college admissions \n\nAITA for sending an email to the school?\n\n----+----+----+\n\nEdit to add, to address the question \"Did you talk to your parents / What did you say?\"\n\nI told them about the video she put up of me and they told her to take it away but they didn't really get what was going on because they're not tech savvy and don't even try to be. \n\nI think they don't understand the problem, because honestly the videos don't make a lot of sense... They're like bizarre tik tok memes that I don't even reallly get. \n\nSo from their perspective, my sister did some vague bizarre \"computer thing\" that they don't understand...  And then all of a sudden the school and other parents are involved, and the scholarship is being taken away with no warning.\n\n----+----+----+\n\nSecond edit to address the question \"Why did you go so nuclear / Did you know what the consequences of involving the school would be?\"\n\nI actually have seen bullying get reported to the school before, and they absolutely brushed it under the rug. Hell, I was half expecting to get no response at all after having sent the email anonymously.\n\nSo I was surprised they actually did more than a slap on the wrist or a handwavey \"well there's two sides to every story\" or \"well, kids will be kids\" \n\nHowever, after it's all said and done, I don't think what happened was \"nuclear\" or disproportionate. \n\nTo be honest, I think a valedictorian should be someone who represents the school in a positive light, leads by example, etc. They have the honor of giving a speech to celebrate the whole grade's graduation. \n\nAnd the way my sister behaved... Was not that of a leader or a positive role model. \n\nThe girl who's valedictorian now is honestly so much more of a positive role model, she's hardworking and kind. She's also faced some bullying for her quirks from having been homeschooled up to the age of 16, and she's always handled herself with kindness and dignity.\n\n----+----+----+\n\nEdit to address the question... \"How are you sure it was bullying if you didn't get the tik tok meme humor? / What was in the videos?\"\n\nThere was some stuff that was pretty obviously bullying, like a video of a learning disabled student having a breakdown, cut in with my sister and her friends dancing in a way that made fun of him, cut back to him, etc... \n\nOr one of a girl and a guy at school having an argument about their relationship, something really private and emotional, cut in with some pop song snippets and my sister doing some weird dance where she was slapping herself?? \n\nLike I don't get the whole tik tok meme context but she was super obviously filming people at embarrassing or personal moments to make fun...", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "score": 5018, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 1741, "archived": true, "author": "MadiAvi", "distinguished": null, "media": NaN}, "comments_to_posts": {"created_utc": 1589841070, "id": "fr2oskz", "body": "YATA.

What to expect?", "selftext": "Hey guys so I’m really panicking right now and hope I could get some answers. \n\nI have a stomach disorder called cyclic vomiting syndrome that often causes me to be violently ill followed by days of lethargy. It’s triggered by heat, chaos, hunger, etc. There is no known cause or cure. My CVS has been really bad this month, and in the past 13 days I’ve lost my dose 3x. It was also miscalculated because I would be afraid to take the whole thing at once in fear of throwing up. \n\nSince the virus thing, we have been getting 2 weeks of takehomes at a time, and the clinic is always crowded and chaotic in the morning. The thought alone sends my stomach into sheer panic. \n\nSo today (Sunday) starting a full 24 hours at least before I go dose, I get chest crushing anxiety and diarrhea, my favorite methadone withdrawal symptoms. Honestly? I’ve been suffering so much for the past 2 weeks overall that I can’t take this. I’m going to have my boyfriend take me to the ER this afternoon because I need some kind of relief.\n\nWhat should I expect? Don’t want to be seen as a drug seeker because I’m in withdrawals. My clinic is useless, I told them about this in advance and they said they were sorry I’m not “feeling good” and that’s that.\n\nThanks for all your help. I’m truly panicking and I know that it doesn’t help, especially my stomach. Not sure how to get relief in the meantime.\n\nEdit:: I think some of you may have forgotten or haven’t experienced the helplessness that vomiting, anxiety and weakness causes. I never said that the pandemic isn’t important, but just because I don’t have COVID doesn’t mean they will turn me away at the hospital. \n\nEDIT::: IF YOUR GUT TELLS YOU THAT YOU NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, GO!!! So here is what happened at the hospital. I checked in and my boyfriend had to literally wheel me in the front door I was so weak. They immediately took great care of me, gave me a bag of fluids, promethazine and some Ativan which helped my withdrawal symptoms. They thought i had gallbladder issues, but all my lab work came back normal. So my CVS and withdrawals were basically going hand in hand. \n\nI didn’t have to really ask for anything. It was also only $50 (I’m uninsured) and I applied for the charity care. If you are ever feeling helpless, don’t be afraid to go get help no matter what is going on with the pandemic. Even if you are uninsured, there are financial assistance programs that most hospitals offer. \n\nI finally was able to make it to the clinic to dose and get my 2 weeks of takehomes. I did a drug screen and saw my counselor, where I gave her my hospital paperwork since I was given Ativan. My dose is slowly starting to kick in and alleviate my symptoms.

This is a petty one.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I are both working at home during the current situation.  Without the commute, we have a few extra hours a day so I have been cooking a lot while we are stuck at home.  I’m a good home cook so I have been doing the majority of the cooking and he does the majority of the cleaning up.  He’s a bit of a fussy eater but not too bad and I mostly work around it.\n\nSo the other night, I made chicken wings with a honey garlic sauce. As my bf was clearing up, I asked him to take the chicken bones off our plates, rinse them off (to remove any bits of sauce) and put them in a large baggie I keep in the freezer.  I collect chicken bones, like if I roast a chicken , and any ends of vegetables like celery tops, carrot peelings and onion. I stick them in the freezer and every week or two, I throw them into the Instant Pot to make chicken stock. I use the stock to make soup or sauces or whatever. \n\nWhen my bf found out that I was doing this, he was appalled. He feels this practice is unhygienic as I was using chicken bones that were people’s plates and half chewed. He wasn’t happy about the old veg either.  He was even less pleased when he realized that the Italian Wedding soup (with homemade meatballs, I might add)  he had for lunch was made with reclaimed chicken bone broth. He said that it was unsanitary and a restaurant would never have such a disgusting practice. I said I’m not running a restaurant and there’s no germs in the stock after two hours high pressure in the Instant Pot.\n\nSo who’s the asshole?", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 45, "archived": true, "author": "Blue_petunia", "distinguished": null, "media": NaN}, "comments_to_posts": {"created_utc": 1588305189, "id": "fp4qwyh", "body": "Most people save bones from holiday birds or rotisserie carcasses to make their bone broth.

Can we have one night where we take a break?”\n\nShe replied with “is it chaotic for you?” in a patronizing tone and then “he’s not gonna be here this weekend”.\n\nBefore this interaction, we were hanging out and talking like we do every night. She wouldn’t talk to me at all afterward.\n\nI started a random bs conversation to break the tension and she looked at me funny like “why are you talking to me” and I dropped it. \n\nShe got rid of the food she was making for dinner without eating and went to her room and shut the door, which is very out of character for her.\n\nA little time went by and I knocked on her door and asked if we could talk. She responded with “I’m not emotionally available right now”. It felt kinda petty, like she was trying get back at me or something.\n\nLast week she told me that I needed to ask for what I needed rather than building up expectations and resentments. I’m not very good at this.\n\nI’m honestly really confused and am questioning my reality of the interaction.\n\nMaybe I could have ridden it out until the remodel was over in a week or two.\n\nI’ve struggled with self-centeredness in the past. I might have been an asshole for asking her to sacrifice a day of work to have a night of peace. She’s really trying to get this project accomplished.\n\nEdit: syntax", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 21, "archived": true, "author": "almoststable", "distinguished": null, "media": NaN}, "comments_to_posts": {"created_utc": 1589342624, "id": "fqgc5xg", "body": "Info: how long have you been roommates and what is the rent arrangement?", "score": 2, "author": "grilledjalapenos", "parent_id": "girhc3"}, "comments_to_comments_1": {"created_utc": 1589342718, "id": "fqgcay6", "body": "Since January.

Ideally, they should have continued from deception and retconned armageddon, and that whole plotline because thats an \"end of the series\" plot.
